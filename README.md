# Quartz v4 - fork

This is a fork of [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) by jackyzha0.

It adds a few features that I wanted to have in my own digital garden:

- Support for removing the first h1 heading of a note
- Support for using a custom key as the note title

All credits go to the original author. I just added the few features that I wanted to have and that were not welcome in the original project.
